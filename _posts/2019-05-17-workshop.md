### Program

The general purpose of this workshop is to bring together spinal cord MRI researchers and
clinicians from around the world, discuss the technical issues and the new challenges to
overcome over the next years related to acquisition and processing of data and
come up with collaborative solutions.

This year's workshop will focus on presenting results of the [Spinal Cord Generic MRI Protocol](http://www.spinalcordmri.org/protocols), for which ~35 sites worldwide participated in a publicly-available database of high-quality quantitative MRI data.
